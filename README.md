As mentioned earlier we have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this game.
In this game we have two characters Dragon and Dino.
This game features an increment in the score when Dino dodges Dragon.
In case Dino crashes with the dragon, the game ends, i.e. game over.
An additional sound can be heard when the game is over.
